This is an infrastructure project.

A graphql aggregator to use as BFF of the multiple apps, leveraging the infra to deploy from the main repo.

todo: what happens when I use the same port? Can i put range of ports in the elb, use the same port for all the apps?
todo: check why i cant pull the image, permissions?? maybe it is hardcode to the other repo (probably happen because the other apply destroy this)

todo: use aggregator as the front of the app connecting with trader-tracker
todo: implement a healthcheck of the aggregator using express middleware
